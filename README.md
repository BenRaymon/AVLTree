# AVLTree

Balanced Binary Search Tree Project for CISC220: Data Structures (Fall 2020). The tree that is loaded into the program contains generic information submitted by other students in the class. 
This project demonstrates features of an AVL tree with pre-order, in-order, and post-order printing. Additional features include the ability to search for, add, or remove a student from the tree while maintaining the balanced properties.
